The R3XS Community Image now supports multiple screen panels. To ensure your display works correctly, you can select the right panel using **Panel Picker Mode**.

## 🕹️ Entering Panel Picker Mode

To enter **Panel Picker Mode**, hold the correct button combination during boot:

**Hold the Hotkey (R1) + one of the following buttons while powering on:**

| R1 + Button | Panel # | Description             |
|-------------|---------|-------------------------|
| **UP**       | 1       | Panel 1             |
| **RIGHT**       | 2       | Panel 2             |
| **DOWN**       | 3       | Panel 3             |
| **LEFT**       | 4       | Panel 4             |
| **X**       | 5       | Panel 5 (Soy Sauce Console)    |
| **A**       | 0       | Original Panel (Stock)  |

Once a valid combination is detected:
- The system will turn the device off — you will need to boot it normally afterward with the selected configuration.
- The screen will display a logo when powered back on.


## 🔁 Changing the Panel Later

You can re-enter Panel Picker Mode at any time:

1. Power off the device.
2. Power it back on **while holding R1 + your new panel button**.
3. Wait a few seconds for the system to apply the new panel and power off.

> **Note:** To disable Panel Picker Mode, **hold R1 + Volume Down while powering on**.


## ℹ️ Tips

> [!CAUTION]
> **Do not enter Panel Picker Mode immediately on first boot.**  
  The system performs its initial setup the first time it powers on, which can take up to **10 minutes**.  
  Let this process complete before powering off or trying to change the panel.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - Press the button **early during boot**, as soon as the device powers on.
> - Only **one** button should be pressed along with R1.
> - If no button is pressed, the system will boot with the previously saved panel configuration.
